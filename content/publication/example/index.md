abstract: In this paper, we investigate how to optimize the federated edge
  learning (FEEL) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled Internet of Things
  (IoT) for B5G/6G networks. Federated learning is an effective framework to
  train a shared model between decentralized edge devices and servers without
  exchanging raw data, which helps protect data privacy. In UAV-enabled IoT
  networks, latency and energy consumption are two important metrics limiting
  the performance of FEEL. Although most of the existing works have studied how
  to reduce latency and improve energy efficiency, only a few of them have
  investigated the impact of the devicesâ€™ limited batteries on FEEL. Motivated
  by this, we study the battery-constrained FEEL, where the UAVs can adjust
  their operating CPU-frequencies to prolong battery life and avoid dropping
  from federated learning training untimely. We optimize the system by jointly
  allocating the computational resources and wireless bandwidth in time-varying
  environments based on a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based
  strategy, where a linear combination of latency and energy consumption is used
  to evaluate the system cost. In this end, simulation results are demonstrated
  to show that the proposed strategy outperforms the conventional ones. In
  particular, it enables all the devices to complete all rounds of FEEL with
  limited batteries and reduce the system cost effectively in the meantime.
